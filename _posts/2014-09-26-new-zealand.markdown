This illustrated map visually showcases the transportation methods, days, and driving durations for a road trip in New Zealand. Taking a whimsical approach, I exhibited the routes and forms of transportation that the trip would entail via a plane, a campervan, a boat, and a train. The distance key shows the driving duration between the cities. I also included sleep "bubbles" to represent the duration of a stay, with each "Z" representing one night. Finally, I depicted the types of animals native to New Zealand, and things to see and do on the North Island.  

The map was the cover image for a multi-page travel guide, setting forth the day-by-day activity guide.  I set the informal guide in a loose, angled layout, reminiscent of a handwritten travel journal, and organized the layout for print using Adobe InDesign.  The final 8.5"x5.5" book was printed on a semi-gloss paper, folded, and staple bound.
