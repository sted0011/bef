<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 project-description">From conception to paper selection, this project was under my direction.  I created a bold, angular recruiting handout to set Trading Technologies apart.  The initial folded square unfolds with two triangular flaps into a polygon, shapes that reflect the angular logo and brand designs.  The handout's other on-brand visuals include overlapping linear rectangles set at a 45-degree angle; a full-color, moodier photograph; and macro views of the software product.</div>
