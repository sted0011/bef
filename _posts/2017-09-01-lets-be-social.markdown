<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 project-description">An integral piece of digital marketing design is social media.  I craft moving and still visuals for social media channels, prepare messaging templates, curate photographic collections, and provide short messaging.  To support consistent companywide social media delivery, I have produced one-page visual style guides, including recommendations on filters, tones, and compositions.<br><br>

Recently, I developed a multi-week, multi-platform social media plan to promote company design and creative efforts.  This effort includes blog generation, messaging and hashtag selection, still visuals, video clips, and animated GIFs.  It touched Medium, Instagram, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and other digital outlets, and included copywriting and visual content generation.<br><br>

Below you can see a collection of previous snappy, cheerful animations I produced; on-brand messaging templates I composed; and a selection of focused, engaging photographs I curated into a meaningful and effective social media resources library.  </div>
