Making a spreadsheet of data come alive is no easy task.  This map shows the connections between cities and latency pathways for trading on Trading Technologies' software. I crafted a design that built upon an existing foundation for an interactive map, but which brought to the forefront the lines of connection and the cities where the exchanges reside.  A quick mouse rollover brings the information into focus without overwhelming the viewer on initial load.  The map is a SVG, which was colored and sized using CSS and JS. It is fully responsive and holds true to the brand's colors and fonts.
