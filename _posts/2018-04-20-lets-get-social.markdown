<b><br/>For: Trading Technologies</b><br/>
<b>Role: Designer / Group Project</b>

An integral piece of digital marketing design is social media.  I craft moving and still visuals for social media channels, prepare messaging templates, curate photographic collections, and provide short messaging.  And, to support consistent companywide social media delivery, I have produced one-page visual style guides, including recommendations on filters, tones, and compositions.

The latest project that I am leading is to develop a multi-week, multi-channel marketing and social media plan to promote company design and creative efforts.  This effort includes blog generation, messaging and hashtag selection, still visuals, video clips, and animated GIFs.  It touches Instagram, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and other digital outlets, and includes copywriting and visual content generation.

Below you can see examples of snappy, cheerful animations I produced; on-brand messaging templates I composed; and a selection of focused, engaging photographs I curated into a meaningful and effective social media resources library.

> We human beings are social beings. We come into the world as the result of others’ actions. We survive here in dependence on others. Whether we like it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives when we do not benefit from others’ activities. For this reason, it is hardly surprising that most of our happiness arises in the context of our relationships with others. <cite>― Dalai Lama XIV</cite>
