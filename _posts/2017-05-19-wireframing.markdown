For a glimpse inside of my development process: here is a plan for a refresh of an existing website.  I culminated my ideas for how the site can better accomplish its goals into several rough sketches detailing how to reorder and reshape the information in a logic pathway in order to better serve visitors.  Then, I turned the best of those ideas into wireframes of the pages.  With those wireframes, I mapped out a user flow throughout the site, and ulimately derived a mockup of the new site.
