This is a logo concept for Elastic Method.  Elastic Method is company built around a methodology for implementing software development processes.  For the company's logo, management sought a simple, flat design that conveyed the adaptable nature of its methodology. Accordingly, this design starts with a fluid line, which forms an 'e.' The line loops into itself, just as the company's method moves seamlessly through the software development process. The black and white contrast is bold, and the text is lower case, conveying approachability and ease of implementation. The design is created to easily scale, and was created with Adobe Illustrator.
