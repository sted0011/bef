I am a designer who can digitally implement designs. I work regularly in HTML/CSS and Sass/SCSS, and always build responsively. I built this portfolio site using Jekyll, but I work regularly within WordPess, and use GitHub for version control.

Beyond websites, I can build and tailor email templates, often delivering them through MailChimp, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Marketo.

<b>Role: Digital Implementation / Group Project</b>

Here are examples of landing pages that I coded for Trading Technologies.  In both cases I was provided a desktop design to code, and made decisions as to how the page would respond down.  The first example was coded in HTML/CSS, and the second was built by tailoring a Wordpress theme.
