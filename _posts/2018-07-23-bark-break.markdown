My current side project is a dog-walking app.  I’m through the research, conception, and branding phases, and I’m onto the UI element design and mockup portions of project.  I’m building out the screens in Sketch, and I will prototype in InVision where I have a project board for the app developed.

My vision for the beta version is to guide users through a few key actions to schedule and update short-notice on-demand walks for their dog(s).  I’m starting with a limited number of actions, but I have several ideas of how I could design out additional functionality in future iterations.  Stay tuned to see how this project progresses.
