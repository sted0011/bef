<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 project-description">Yeah, that's actually me pictured above.  I am a designer who can digitally implement designs. I work regularly in HTML/CSS and Sass/SCSS, and always build responsively. I built this portfolio site using Jekyll, but I work regularly within WordPress, and use GitHub for version control.<br><br>

Beyond websites, I can build and tailor email templates, often delivering them through MailChimp, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Marketo.<br><br>

Here are examples of landing pages that I coded for Trading Technologies.  The first example shows a web page I both designed and coded within our custom Wordpress theme.  For the latter two examples, I was provided a desktop design to code, and made decisions as to how the pages would respond down.  One example was coded in pure HTML/CSS, and the second was built by tailoring a Wordpress theme.</div>
