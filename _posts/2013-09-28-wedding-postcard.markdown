Weddings are, by nature, personal events that express the nature of the people getting married.  Mine was no exception.  The event was particularly personal because I designed the day (and everything in it) from top to bottom.  For me, building out all the graphical elements for the day added so much joy to the planning process.

This postcard is part of a set of six postcards I designed as an alternative to a guestbook. The full-color two-sided design draws on the theme of travel. My inspiration started with the utilitarian layout of a standard postcard -- picture on the front, blank space on the back -- inviting guests into the communication form. The primary image on the front side, a map, identifies significant locations and how they relate geographically to the wedding's location. The silhouette of a tree represents the ceremony site, and a text box and arrows help underscore the geographic significance. These elements are all rotated slightly, as if they were pasted in a scrapbook, giving the card a whimsical, folk art feel.  Although the main purpose of the reverse side was to provide blank space to write, I added personalized touches in the form of a cancelation stamp with the ceremony's location and date, and a postage stamp made from an engagement portrait.

The postcards were designed in Adobe Photoshop and printed on thick, shiny card stock.
