<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 project-description">I created a series of postcards as an alternative to a wedding guestbook. Several of the full-color two-sided designs draw on the theme of travel. The primary image on the front side is a map, identifying a significant location, and the supplemental images and text underscore the geographic significance. The elements are positioned to give the cards a whimsical, folk art feel.  Although the main purpose of the reverse side was to provide blank space to write, I added a cancelation stamp with the ceremony's location and date, and a postage stamp with an engagement photo.<br><br>

The postcards were designed in Adobe Photoshop and printed on shiny card stock. </div>
