<b>For: Personal Project</b><br/>
<b>Role: Art Direction + Design</b>

This postcard is part of a series of postcards I designed as an alternative to a wedding guestbook. This full-color two-sided design draws on the theme of travel. The primary image on the front side, a map, identifies significant locations and how they relate geographically to the wedding's location. The silhouette of a tree was from a photograph taken at the ceremony site, and a text box and arrows help underscore the geographic significance. These elements are all rotated slightly, as if they were pasted in a scrapbook, giving the card a whimsical, folk art feel.  Although the main purpose of the reverse side was to provide blank space to write, I added personalized touches in the form of a cancelation stamp with the ceremony's location and date, and a postage stamp made from an engagement photo.

The postcards were designed in Adobe Photoshop and printed on shiny card stock.
