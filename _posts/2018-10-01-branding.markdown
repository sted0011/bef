<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 project-description">While Trading Technologies has a distinctive blue logo mark and brand identity for its core business, the company needed a separate, evolved identity for a new product line in cryptocurrencies.  To shape the new identity, I gathered research about the market, distilled our position to four primary pillars, and through design iterations with key players, exemplified those pillars into core visual representations and colors.  My colleague developed a distinguished logo mark in the new brand color scheme, and I created the logo lockup, as well as the orientation variations.  I also crafted examples of the logo and brand assets in digital and print marketing materials, and prepared assets for use in the product app.</div>
