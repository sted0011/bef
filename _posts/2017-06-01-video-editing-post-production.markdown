A good video presentation tells you a story; a great one takes you on an emotional journey. My video editing experience is an outgrowth being moved to tell personal stories.  Melding together music, motion, and still photography, I present snapshots of familial and collegial life with real human experience as the focus. Because the nature of this work is personal, I am happy to provide you a direct link upon request.

Beyond straight videoediting, sometimes a story needs a little boost.  This is where post-production work comes in.  In the humorous spoof video C.A.R.L., I collaborated with a small team to help give life to a drone desipte the limitations of navigating a drone indoors.  I assisted with the planning, prop rigging, staging, and post-production string removal necessary to bring the drone alive.  The drone hovers, flies, and pops into frame, all without the rigging being seen.
