A good video presentation tells you a story; a great one takes you on an emotional journey. My video editing work has been an outgrowth of being moved to tell personal stories.  Melding together music, motion, and still photography, I present snapshots of familial and collegial life with real human experience as the focus. Take a quick peek at <a href="https://vimeo.com/276660710" target="_blank">one of my video editing projects</a> (ping me for the password).

Beyond video editing, sometimes a story needs a little boost.  This is where post-production work comes in.  In the humorous spoof video C.A.R.L., I collaborated with a small team to help give life to a drone despite the limitations of navigating a drone indoors.  I assisted with the planning, prop rigging, staging, and post-production string removal necessary to bring the drone alive.  The drone hovers, flies, and pops into frame, all without the rigging being seen.
