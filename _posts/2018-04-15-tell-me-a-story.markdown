Dreams are rarely realized without planning, and so too are animations without storyboards.  Here you see my process as I explore the character and colors that will set the stage for a future animation.  These characters are flat with a cutout style. The character exploration details how their arms hinge on their bodies with singular ligatures and how minimal varying details will add just enough to differentiate their roles while keeping the look uniform.  The color palette presents a primarily blue and neutral base with bright pops of color, and the two storyboard excerpts show how the movement will tie to the narrative, setting the stage for the story to be told by the charactersâ€™ movement.
