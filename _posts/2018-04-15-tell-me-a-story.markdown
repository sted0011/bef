Here you see my process behind my animations as I present the character and colors that will set the stage for a future animation.  These characters are flat with rounded shapes in a cutout style. The character exploration details how their arms hinge on their bodies with singular ligatures and how minimal varying details will add just enough to differentiate their roles while keeping their look uniform.  The color palette presents a primarily blue and neutral base with both bright and deep pops of color, and the two storyboard page excerpts show how the movement will tie to the narrative, setting the stage for the story to be told by the charactersâ€™ movement.
