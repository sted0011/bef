<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4 project-description"><h1>Project</h1></div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 project-description">I produced a recruiting video that blends a cohesive narrative, symmetrical shots, a washed-out color palette, upbeat 60s-inspired music, and situational silliness to show off, not only how we work together as one company, but how we make it fun too.  This award-winning video is the culmination of hours of planning and team effort.  As producer of an in-house six-person team, I kept the team on track, organized and scheduled the shots/props/spaces, identified the musical track, participated in the shoots, and provided feedback during the editing process.  As motion graphics designer, I supplied the moving visuals for the countdown and the two language clouds.<br><br>

The video won a <a href="https://creativityawards.com/?submission=come-work-with-us" target="_blank">Gold Creativity International Award</a> and a <a href="http://contests.gdusa.com/gdusa-contest-winner?cc=aida18&ids=0|112357&iy=2018&im=08" target="_blank">GDUSA American Inhouse Design Award</a>.
