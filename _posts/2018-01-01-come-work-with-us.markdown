This recruiting video I collaborated on blends a cohesive narrative, symmetrical shots, a washed-out color palette, upbeat 60s-inspired music, and situational silliness to show off, not only how we work together as one company, but how we make it fun too.  This award-winning video is the culmination of hours of planning and team effort.  On our in-house six-person team, I was the producer and animator.  As producer, I kept the team on track, organized and scheduled the shots/props/spaces, identified the musical track, participated in the shoots, and provided feedback during the editing process.  I also supplied the animations for the countdown and the two language clouds.

The video won a <a href="https://creativityawards.com/?submission=come-work-with-us" target="_blacnk">Gold Creativity International Award</a> and a GDUSA American Inhouse Design Award.
