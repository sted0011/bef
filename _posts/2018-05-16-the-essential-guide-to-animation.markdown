Here is a highlight reel of some of my quick character animations.  Unified under the narrative of a how-to-animate video, this fast-paced visual collage showcases straight-forward animation techniques and abbreviated storytelling arcs, all aimed at getting you smiling.

Most communication is non-verbal, and therefore giving life to flat characters requires an animator to conveying emotional, anatomical, and expressive intelligence to quickly communicate with an audience.  Watch as this woodland creature, guitarist robot, and dancing leprechaun rapidly reveal their inner lives through quick gestures and facial expressions.  Very little is said, but the message is clear: work hard, be original, be brave, and keep going until the very end.
