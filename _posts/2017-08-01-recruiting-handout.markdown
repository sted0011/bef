This company desired a bold and different handout that stood out from the pack.  My design for a square piece with triangular flaps that unfolds to an polygon, incorporates shapes that reflect the angular logo and brand.  The handout's visuals stay on brand with overlapping linear rectangles set at a 45-degree angle; a full-color, moodier photograph; and macro views of the software product (which were drawn in Illustrator to ensure a crisp presentation).  The handouts are a delightful complement to my vertical popup booth banner, also pictured.
