A good recruiting video draws you in, shows you the people and culture, and makes you smile.  Our video blends together a cohesive narrative, symmetrical shots, a washed-out color palette, upbeat 60s-inspired music, and situational silliness to show off, not only how we work together as one company, but how we make it fun too.  This award-winning video is the culmination of hours of planning and team effort.  On our in-house six-person team, I served as the producer and animator.  As producer, I kept the team on track, organized and scheduled the shots/props/spaces, identified the musical track, and participated in the shoots and editing process.  I also supplied the animations for the countdown and the two language clouds.

The video won a Gold Creativity International Award and a a GDUSA American Inhouse Design Award.
