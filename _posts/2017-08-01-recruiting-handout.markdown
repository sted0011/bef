Trading Technologies requested a bold and different handout that stood out from the pack.  I conceived of an inital square handout unfolds to an polygon, shapes reflecting the angular logo and brand.  The handout's visuals incorporate brand elements: overlapping linear rectangles set at a 45-degree angle; a full-color, moodier photograph; and a macro views of the software product that I drew in Illustrator to ensure their crisp presentation.
