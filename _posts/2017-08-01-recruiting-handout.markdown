This bold, angular recruiting handout sets Trading Technologies apart.  The initial folded square unfolds with two triangular flaps into a polygon -- shapes that reflect the angular logo and brand.  The handout's on-brand visuals include overlapping linear rectangles set at a 45-degree angle; a full-color, moodier photograph; and macro views of the software product.  The handouts complement the vertical popup booth banner, with its slanted mirrored images and subtle rectangular patterns.
