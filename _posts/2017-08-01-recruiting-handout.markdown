Trading Technologies wanted a recruiting handout that stood out.  The square handout unfolds to an polygon, both shapes reflecting the angular brand and logo.  The visuals also incorporate brand elements: overlapping linear rectangles set at a 45-degree angle, full-color moodier photographs, and a macro view of our software product.
