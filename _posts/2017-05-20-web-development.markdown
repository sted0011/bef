If you need a designer who can implement, I have you covered. I work regularly in HTML/CSS and SCSS to bring my designs online.  I am a stickler for responsiveness, and always check that my implementations look good on a smaller scale.  I built this portfolio site using Jekyll, but I work regularly within WordPess as well.  In both instances I go through GitHub to make updates to the sites.  

Beyond this portfolio site, here is another website you can check out.  It is also built on a Jekyll framework, relies on Bootstrap, and is evolving constantly.  Keeping its evolution in mind, in setting forth the style file structure, I aimed to create conventions likely to make sense for future iterations of the site.  

In this project I started from an existing design for a desktop help library.  In ensuring the site would be responsive, I added to the design the mobile approach necessary to display the site not only on mobile, but also in a an in-app help feature within the software to which it relates.  The collapsable menu is pure CSS, and I designed a several icons and navigational items to fit within the existing look-and-feel of the site's brand.

The other ways that I use my skills is to build and tailor email templates, which often requires inline styling (I know: eek!).  For this work, I am proficient with MailChimp, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Marketo design tools.
