I am a designer who can digitally implement designs. I work regularly in HTML/CSS and SCSS and pay close attention to responsiveness. I built this portfolio site using Jekyll, but I work regularly within WordPess, and use GitHub for version control.

Beyond websites, I can build and tailor email templates, often delivering them through MailChimp, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Marketo.
