If you need a designer who can implement designs online, I have you covered. I work regularly in HTML/CSS and SCSS and pay close attention to responsiveness, so my implementations will look good at scale.  I built this portfolio site using Jekyll, but I work regularly within WordPess as well.  In both instances I use GitHub to make updates to the sites.  

The other way that I use these skills is to build and tailor email templates, which often requires inline styling (I know: eek!).  For this work, I am proficient with MailChimp, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Marketo design tools.
