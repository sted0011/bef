<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 project-description">HealthEngine, a Chicago-based tech startup, needed top-to-toe logo refresh and branding. My engagement with HealthEngine started with my proposed logo redesign. Leadership sought a straightforward, bold design that translated both to digital and print. My proposal beat out several competitive designs and lead to me taking a deeper dive into the company's digital personality and branding.<br><br>

On the logo: The design combines the letters 'h' and 'e' with imagery of a gear -- with a wink to a steam engine -- to convey the brand's strength of purpose. The bold, straight lines of the sans serif 'h' keep the logo modern, while the light gradient resonating from the 'e' suggest the company's purpose: to shine a light on healthcare pricing.<br><br>

I created a multi use online and print style guide for the logo, and implemented the logo on business cards and letterhead designs.<br><br>

On the brand: To build out the company's brand and identity, I designed a suite of marketing materials for the sales team. The package included one-page informational sheets, magnets, small cards, and postcards. I unified the suite with similar background designs and used the company colors and complementary messaging throughout. <br><br>

On the website: The company needed an informational website to reach its customer base and deliver easy-to-understand FAQs. In the initial (now former) iteration of the website, the company asked for a clean and modern website that looked great on both large scale and mobile displays. I kept the color palette simple, drawing on the logo's two shades of blue, which were paired with shades of whites and grays, and I set off with a pop of orange for contrast on the call-to-action elements. I created all of the photo collages and graphic icons for the site with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and made minor adjustments to implement both the jQuery for the Captcha and the PHP for the submission of the contact form to trigger an email send.</div>
