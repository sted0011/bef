<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 project-description">For a glimpse inside of my development process: here is a visual plan for the refresh of an informational website. <br><br>

I started with sketching out several ideas for how the site could better accomplish its goals.  Primarily, I wanted to reorder and reshape the information into a logical path that would reflect how visitors learn about the product. <br><br>

I turned the best of those ideas into wireframes of the pages, and then mapped out how the users could flow through the site.  The mockup of the new site is the final step to showing how everything will come together in a tangible way.</div>
