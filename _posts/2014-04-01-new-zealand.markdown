<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8 project-description">This illustrated map visually showcases the transportation methods, days, and driving durations for a road trip in New Zealand. Taking a whimsical approach, I exhibited the routes and forms of transportation that the trip would entail via a plane, a campervan, a boat, and a train. I  included sleep "bubbles" representing the duration of a stay, a driving distance key, and depictions of the animals and things to see on the North Island.  <br><br>

The map is the cover image for a multi-page day-by-day travel guide.  The book was setup for print using Adobe InDesign.  </div>
