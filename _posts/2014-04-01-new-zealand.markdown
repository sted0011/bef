This illustrated map visually showcases the transportation methods, days, and driving durations for a road trip in New Zealand. Taking a whimsical approach, I exhibited the routes and forms of transportation that the trip would entail via a plane, a campervan, a boat, and a train. The distance key shows the driving duration between the cities. I also included sleep "bubbles" representing the duration of a stay, and depicted the types of animals and things to see on the North Island.  

The map is the cover image for a multi-page informal travel guide styled as a handwritten travel journal.  The book was setup for print using Adobe InDesign.
