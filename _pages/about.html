          <p class="author_subtitle">My right brain flourishes: I'm a designer, visual crafter, and idea connector.  I like to make <a href="http://tskcreative.com/guide-to-animation/">leprechauns</a> and <a href="http://tskcreative.com/lets-be-social/">turkeys</a> dance.  That said, my left brain is equally engaged: I'm logical, strategic, and orderly. I have legal honors and accomplishments based on these skills.  Bring these together and you have <span class="highlight">a powerhouse designer who can anticipate outcomes, solve problems, and digitally implement</span> (translation: I can code too).</p>  
         <p class="author_subtitle">Hi. I'm a full-time, full-stack designer, adept at managing and executing multiple projects simultaneously. I am both highly productive and easygoing in situations of rapid change.  I do website planning and implementation, craft graphic design and photographic direction, and I produce social media and other visual assets. This year, I won two design awards for <a href="http://tskcreative.com/come-work-with-us/">my video production and animation work</a>.  Always eager to gain new skills, I am wireframing and prototyping a dog-walking app for fun.</p>
          <p class="author_subtitle_heading">Creative. Strategic. Smart.</p>
          <p class="author_subtitle">Formal education?  Sure, I have that too. I was trained in web design at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, studied Journalism, Advertising, and Public Relations at the University of Minnesota, and mastered law at The George Washington University. In other words, I am a curious creative who loves the Oxford comma.{% endif %}</p>
