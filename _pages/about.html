          <p class="author_subtitle">Tiffany is a full-time full-stack designer who sometimes finds it odd to write about herself in the third person.  She is adept at managing and executing multiple projects simultaneously, and people compliment her for being both highly productive and easygoing in situations of rapid change.</p><p class="author_subtitle">Most recently, Tiffany has been responsible for being a brand champion across website planning and implementation, graphic design and photographic direction, and crafting social media and other visual assets for an international leader in SaaS futures trading software. She recently won two design awards for her video production and animation work, and she can assemble a mean Halloween costume.  Always eager to gain new skills, she is wireframing and prototyping a dog-walking app in her free time.</p>
          <p class="author_subtitle"><b>Creative. Strategic. Smart.</b></p>
          <p class="author_subtitle">Tiffany is trained in web design at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago; studied Journalism, Advertising, and Public Relations at the University of Minnesota; and mastered law at The George Washington University. In short, she is a fan of the Oxford comma.{% endif %}</p>
